### Algorithm for operating servo tensor motors to form the robot's walking motion :

1. *Determine GPIO Pins*: Determine the pin numbers that you will use to connect the servo motors to the control board.
2. *Initialize variables*: Set necessary variables such as PWM frequency and initial angles of servo motors.
3. *GPIO Setup*: Use the command GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM) and GPIO.setup(pin, GPIO.OUT) to configure the GPIO pins.
4. *Create PWM objects*: Use GPIO.PWM(pin, frequency) to create PWM objects for each servo motor.
5. *PWM start*: Use the command pwm.start(initial_duty_cycle) to start controlling the servo motor.
6. *Determine movement angles*: Define the angles that will represent the walking movement of the robot.
7. *Apply walking motion*: Use an iterative cycle to apply motion angles to the servo motors.
8. *Cleanup after completion*: Use the pwm.stop() and GPIO.cleanup() commands to stop PWM and clean up the GPIO settings.
