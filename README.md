### Algorithm for operating servo tensor motors to form the robot's walking motion :

1. *Mechanical Design*:
   - Design the robot's legs and body structure. Consider using lightweight materials like straws or 3D-printed parts.
   - Attach servo motors to the joints where you want movement (e.g., hip, knee, ankle).
   - Ensure the servo horns are securely connected to the robot's limbs.

2. *Servo Calibration*:
   - Connect the servo motors to an Arduino or microcontroller.
   - Calibrate the servo angles (usually between 0° and 180°) to match the desired joint movement.
   - Test each servo individually to verify its range and accuracy.

3. *Walking Algorithm*:
   - Develop an algorithm for walking. Common approaches include:
     - *Wave Gait*: Move the legs in a wave-like pattern (e.g., left-front, right-middle, left-back).
     - *Tripod Gait*: Divide the legs into three groups (tripods) and alternate their movement.
     - *Quadruped Gait*: Similar to tripod gait but with four legs.
   - Determine the sequence and timing for each leg movement.

4. *Programming*:
   - Write code to control the servo motors. Use libraries like Servo.h (for Arduino) or equivalent.
   - Define the servo pins, angles, and delays for each leg movement.
   - Implement the walking algorithm in your code.

5. *Testing and Iteration*:
   - Upload the code to your microcontroller.
   - Observe how the robot walks. Adjust servo angles, delays, and gait parameters as needed.
   - Iterate to improve stability, balance, and overall motion.

6. *Power Supply*:
   - Ensure your servo motors receive sufficient power (usually 5V) to operate effectively.
   - Use a separate power supply if needed.
